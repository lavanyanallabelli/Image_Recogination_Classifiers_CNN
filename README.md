##ðŸŒ¸ Flower Classification using Transfer Learning
This project builds an image classification model to identify flower species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with transfer learning. The task involves fine-tuning a pre-trained image classifier on the Flowers Recognition dataset, which contains 4,317 images across 5 categories: daisy, dandelion, rose, sunflower, and tulip.

#ðŸ§  Project Overview
Goal: Classify flower species with improved accuracy using pre-trained CNNs.

Dataset: 4,317 labeled flower images across 5 classes.

#Approach:

Use pre-trained CNNs (e.g., ResNet50 or VGG16).

Replace the top layers with custom fully connected layers.

Freeze base layers; train only classifier head.

Evaluate on a test split (75/25 ratio).

Implement in TensorFlow and PyTorch.

ðŸ”§ Steps
Data Preparation:

Load and preprocess dataset (resizing, normalization).

Encode labels and split into training/testing sets.

Model Building:

Load pre-trained model (e.g., ResNet50) without top layers.

Add custom classifier layers.

Freeze feature extraction layers.

Training:

Use Adam or SGD optimizers.

Train for ~20 epochs with early stopping.

Evaluate using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.

Evaluation:

Plot confusion matrix.

Visualize model predictions.

ðŸ“Š Results
The fine-tuned model achieved high classification accuracy (~90%+) on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of transfer learning for small image datasets.

ðŸš€ Future Work
Deploy as a web app using Flask or Streamlit.

Experiment with lightweight models (MobileNet).

Try different data augmentation strategies.
